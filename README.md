# Toy Kernel

I figured developing a kernel is one of the best ways to become more familiar
with how operating systems are put together. Initially, this kernel will be
the result of following some tutorials on the OSDev.org wiki, but I would like
to continue hacking on it over time and see how far I can go with it.
